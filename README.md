## ✨ Key Features

### 🌳 Binary Tree Visualizer
- ➕ Insert nodes dynamically to build a binary search tree.
- 🔄 Visualize traversals: **Inorder**, **Preorder**, and **Postorder**.
- 👀 Watch the nodes light up as the traversal happens in real-time.

### 🔗 Graph Visualizer
- ➕ Create directed graphs by adding nodes and edges interactively.
- 🚀 Perform and animate **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.
- 🎯 Select start nodes to explore graph traversal paths visually.

### 🛣️ Dijkstra’s Algorithm Visualizer
- 🗺️ Use a grid layout to simulate weighted graphs.
- 🎯 Place **Start**, **End**, and **Walls** to build scenarios.
- 🎥 Watch the shortest path emerge with step-by-step animation.
- 🟦 Nodes visited and 🟨 shortest path highlighted for clarity.

### 🌟 Future Enhancements
- 🔍 Add **A\*** Pathfinding Algorithm visualizer.
- 🧩 Generate random mazes for advanced pathfinding practice.
- ⚖️ Support weighted edges in graph visualizations.
- 🎞️ Export animations as GIFs or videos for sharing.
- 👤 Implement user authentication to save and share custom graphs.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ⚛️ React.js with hooks & functional components
- 🎨 CSS modules for modular styling
- 💡 Vanilla JavaScript for implementing core algorithms
